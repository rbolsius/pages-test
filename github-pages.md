## Themes

Decent themes:

  - minima (very clean theme with neutral colors and automatic light/dark theme)
  - midnight (nice dark color theme, text is yellow tinted though)
  - slate (high contrast, light theme with clean fonts and neutral colors)

Bad themes:

  - architect
  - cayman (light theme with ridiculously large hero banner, large and clean
    fonts, green/blue color scheme)
  - dinky (bad header font and table borders)
  - hacker (everything is monospaced)
  - leapday (content too narrow, font is too small and not very legible,
    background image diagonal stripes; on the positive side it has a column of
    heading links on the left)
  - merlot (serif font for normal text, way too narrow)
  - minimal (text is too light and poorly antialiased, content is far too
    narrow, site branding column to the left of the content pushes the content
    too far to the right)
  - modernist (terrible body font, patterned background)
  - tactile (poor contrast, list bullets and numbers are oddly aligned too far
    to the left extending into the page margin)
  - time-machine (weird patterned background behind page header, one unique
    feature is that the heading stick to the top of the page when scrolling)
